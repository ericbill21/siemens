# Siemens Mobility’sAI Dependability Assessment

Dependability  and  reliability  of  machine  learningclassification  systems  are  getting  increasingly  important  as  ma-chine  learning  techniques  are  being  applied  in  more  and  moredomains, including safety-critical areas. The task of theSiemensAI Dependability Assessment Student’s Challengeis  to  provide  aclassifier  for  a  given  classification  tasks  as  well  as  to  determinean  as-accurate-as-possible  misclassification  probability  estimate.In  this  paper,  we  describe  the  approach  taken  to  determinesuch  a  probability  estimate:  As  training  data  quality  is  crucialto  model  performance  and  dependability,  we  develop  severalinterpretations  of  training  data  and  use  these  as  indicators  toestimate  model  accuracy.For the three given datasets, our approach promises missclas-sification  rates  no  larger  than  X.XX%,  Y.YY%,  and  Z.ZZ%,respectively.  In  our  validation,  these  upper  limits  on  misclassifi-cation  held  up.
